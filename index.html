                My name is Paul LaBounty and I reside in Springfield, Missouri
                with my wife and six children. I grew up in a small Missouri
                town named Marshfield. Upon completing high school, I attended
                Drury University for law enforcement. I was awarded a
                certificate in law enforcement and Missouri P.O.S.T.
                Certification. I worked for 6+ years as a law enforcement
                officer in the Southwest Missouri area. In addition, I was
                awarded a transportation management certificate from Vatterott
                College in Springfield, MO.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the last 15+ years I have worked extensively in the sales
                industry. I have worked as a high performing manager for
                different cell phone companies including US Cellular and AT&T.
                In addition, I worked as a lucrative sales rep for Welk Resort
                in Branson, Missouri. These careers have led to the development
                of my own sales and marketing company, PNL Enterprises. For the
                last two years, my company has been contracted through different
                companies for sales and marketing expertise. However, due to
                COVID the work for my company has quickly diminished. This life
                event led to my decision to look for additional careers in fast
                growing industries.
              </p>
              <p>
                After completing research, I decided to pursue a certificate in
                Web Development through the University of Kansas’s Coding
                Bootcamp. I enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp course in September
                2020. I have a passion for technology and for gaining further
                understanding, as it is ever-changing. I plan to further my
                education upon completion of the Web Development Program,
                through KU, by gaining certification in Cyber Security. I am
                looking forward to my new career in the fast-growing field of
                Informational Technology.
